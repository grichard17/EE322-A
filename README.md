# Design VI Repository
## Hello! My name is Greyson Richards!
### This repository will serve as an introduction of myself to the class and also catolog my future assignments

**I am a 3/4 EE Major and I am really looking forward to the group project work in this class.**

*Below is a quote from a book I read in highshcool that really encourages me to start my day right.*

>â€œIf you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed." - Admiral William H. McRaven
